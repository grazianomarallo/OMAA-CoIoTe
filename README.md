# OMAA-CoIoTe
CoIoTe is a project wanted by TIM whose goal is to connect IoT objects to the Internet by asking mobile users to create hotspots with their smartphones in return for a little reward.
The goal was to develop a metaheuristic able to solve the constrained optimization problem by assigning missions to users while minimizing the rewards cost and maximizing the number of connected objects.

A parallel, deterministic, greedy-like algorithm has been developed; it demonstrated to be able to solve both the normal and hard instances with results next to the optimum in a limited time.

In the repository there are two folders for the instances and one with the c++ code.
